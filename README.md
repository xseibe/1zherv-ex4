Exercise 4 : Materials and Effects

My custom shaders:
  Table - Followed the instructions in assignment, plus I tried to play with normal map, it turned out kinda well, but had problems with setting Anti-Aliasing correctly to make it look perfect.
  Walls - Added simple shader, that draws lines on wall to give it some basic pattern.
  CounterTop - The counter top looked way too clean to me. So I added some smudge texture and blended it with the original color.
  Floor - Here I tried to experiment a bit. I used Time node to make the floor "move" and made it look a little futuristic.
  Ceiling - My idea was to make the ceiling transparent and create a shader to visualize rain drops falling on the ceiling. I spent a lot of time with this and it did not really turn out as I expected, although it was interesting experience making this type of shader.
